        SaER is a fictional entity I am simply using to complete this
        assignment. I made everything here (besides the images, thanks Adobe
        Stock for those). This is totally professional I think. Hopefully. I am
        not really sure how much is too much, but I tried to basically just be
        funny to fill up this page. Might work. Or maybe ill get like 6 points
        off and get the comment "good job!". Either way, win in my book. You
        probably skimmed this, so back to Science and Entity Research. We are a
        corporation. Big one. But like, are they working for the government?
        Probably. Are they good? Definetly not but do not tell them I told you
        that. Science things, we do that. We are totally not self centered.
