            We are dedicated to you. Through all those things we can help you
            with as a large corporate entity, doing basically anything we want.
            We will act totally within your interests, just do not actually
            check us on that. Just trust us and preferably donate money to us so
            we can lobby the government. We are about you.

          <h4>Protection, Defense, and Security, all in one place.</h4>
          <p>
            Established back in 1989, Science and Entity Research has been
            fighting for good since it was formed. Our mission can be defined in
            one word: success. SaER might be a classified corporation turned to
            an uncontrollable and overreaching entity within the United States,
            but we still have your best interest at heart, even if you might not
            know, not benefit in the slightest, or even are negatively impacted
            by the actions of Science and Entity Research (abbreviated 'SaER').
            You can have blind faith in us not to follow our own interests that
            might negatively impact society and the globe.
          </p>

          <h4>Surprisingly, We are still here</h4>
          <p>
            The Science and Entity Research exec told me, the web developer
            making this site, that I need to make the content for this site. I
            mean, who would do that? I had the feeling that they would not
            actually check the website's text so, just know that if you are
            reading this, a whole board of directors did not even notice this
            little bit. Just kidding, we planned this little bit out. As a silly
            little corporation, we want to show that our brand is special and
            not at all a ploy to get engagement on social media to be memorable
            in consumer's minds. Also, we are logging your every keystroke so
            thanks for that. This part is entirely planned to keep you engaged.
            The longer you read this, the more data we get, so thanks for
            reading.
