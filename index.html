                <h4>Protection, Defense, and Security, all in one place.</h4>
                <p>
                  Established back in 1989, Science and Entity Research has been
                  fighting for good since it was formed. Our mission can be
                  defined in one word: success. SaER might be a classified
                  corporation turned to an uncontrollable and overreaching
                  entity within the United States, but we still have your best
                  interest at heart, even if you might not know, not benefit in
                  the slightest, or even are negatively impacted by the actions
                  of Science and Entity Research (abbreviated 'SaER'). You can
                  have blind faith in us not to follow our own interests that
                  might negatively impact society and the globe.

                <p>
                  The Science and Entity Research exec told me, the web
                  developer making this site, that I need to make the content
                  for this site. I mean, who would do that? I had the feeling
                  that they would not actually check the website's text so, just
                  know that if you are reading this, a whole board of directors
                  did not even notice this little bit. Just kidding, we planned
                  this little bit out. As a silly little corporation, we want to
                  show that our brand is special and not at all a ploy to get
                  engagement on social media to be memorable in consumer's
                  minds. Also, we are logging your every keystroke so thanks for
                  that. This part is entirely planned to keep you engaged. The
                  longer you read this, the more data we get, so thanks for
                  reading.
